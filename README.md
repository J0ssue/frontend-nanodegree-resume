# Project Details
## How did I complete this project?
1. In this project I store my resume data in four javaScript objects.
2. Once I created my javaScript objects, I wrote the code needed to display all of the resume data contained within these objects in my resume.
3. All of the HTML code needed to build the resume is stored in **js/helper.js** variables. The variable names indicate their function. I replaced substrings in these variable string values such as **%data%** and **#** with the data in my javaScript objects, and append or prepend the formatted result to my resume in the appropriate location.

### By the end:
My resume looks like this
https://j0ssue.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume/.

And my repository will includes the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: This file is empty. You should write your code here.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: 
The GitHub readme file.
* and some images in the images directory.
